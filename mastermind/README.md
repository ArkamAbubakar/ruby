# Mastermind

Mastermind is a one-player game where the player attempts to guess the computer's secret code! 

For each guess the player enters, the computer tells the player:

- how many were the correct color AND the correct position (R)
- how many were the correct color but the WRONG position (W)
- and how many were WRONG (*)

The player gets 12 guesses before the computer shuts down, hiding the secret code for all of eternity!!

To play, run
